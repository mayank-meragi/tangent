# Template Settings Control - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
Allow templates to store and control settings like thinking and search, with automatic activation when the template is inserted. This feature will enable users to create templates that not only provide conversation starters but also automatically configure the AI behavior settings for optimal results.

## Problem Statement
Currently, when users insert templates, they need to manually configure settings like thinking budget and web search after the template is inserted. This creates friction and may lead to suboptimal AI responses if users forget to adjust settings or don't know which settings work best for specific template types.

## Solution
Extend the template system to include configurable settings that automatically activate when a template is inserted, ensuring consistent and optimal AI behavior for each template type.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Template Settings Storage
**As a** template creator  
**I want to** specify default settings (thinking budget, web search, model) for my templates  
**So that** when users insert my template, the optimal AI behavior is automatically configured

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Templates can store settings like thinking budget, web search enabled, and model selection
- [ ] Settings are stored in the template's frontmatter metadata
- [ ] Settings are validated when templates are loaded
- [ ] Default values are provided for all settings

### User Story 2: Automatic Settings Activation
**As a** template user  
**I want** the template's settings to automatically activate when I insert a template  
**So that** I get the optimal AI behavior without manual configuration

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When a template is selected and inserted, its settings automatically apply
- [ ] Thinking budget is set to the template's specified value
- [ ] Web search is enabled/disabled based on template settings
- [ ] Model selection is updated to match template preferences
- [ ] User is notified when settings have been automatically changed

### User Story 3: Settings Preview
**As a** template user  
**I want to** see what settings a template will apply before inserting it  
**So that** I can make informed decisions about template selection

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Template dropdown shows settings that will be applied
- [ ] Settings are displayed in a clear, readable format
- [ ] Users can see thinking budget, web search status, and model selection
- [ ] Settings preview is shown in the template description or tooltip

### User Story 4: Settings Override
**As a** template user  
**I want to** override template settings if needed  
**So that** I can customize the AI behavior for my specific use case

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Users can manually change settings after template insertion
- [ ] Manual changes are preserved for the current session
- [ ] Template settings are only applied on initial insertion
- [ ] Clear indication when settings have been manually overridden

### User Story 5: Template Settings Management
**As a** template creator  
**I want to** easily manage and update template settings  
**So that** I can optimize templates based on user feedback and testing

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Template settings can be edited through the template management interface
- [ ] Settings changes are immediately reflected in the template
- [ ] Validation prevents invalid settings combinations
- [ ] Settings history is maintained for version control

## Technical Requirements

### Data Model Extensions
- Extend `ConversationTemplate` interface to include settings
- Add settings validation and default values
- Ensure backward compatibility with existing templates

### UI/UX Requirements
- Settings preview in template dropdown
- Clear visual indicators for automatic settings changes
- Intuitive settings management interface
- Responsive design for all screen sizes

### Performance Requirements
- Settings application should be instantaneous
- No impact on template loading performance
- Efficient settings validation and storage

### Security Requirements
- Settings validation to prevent malicious configurations
- Safe default values for all settings
- Proper error handling for invalid settings

## Success Metrics
- Increased template usage due to improved user experience
- Reduced manual configuration time
- Higher user satisfaction with AI responses
- Increased template creation and sharing

## Out of Scope
- Automatic settings optimization based on conversation context
- Machine learning for settings recommendations
- Settings inheritance between related templates
- Advanced settings like custom tool configurations

# Implementation Tasks: Gemini Web Search Grounding

## Overview
This document contains the detailed implementation tasks for integrating Gemini's built-in grounding with Google Search feature into the Tangent plugin. Tasks are organized into three phases: POC (Proof of Concept), MVP (Minimum Viable Product), and Production.

## Phase 1: POC (Proof of Concept)

### Goal
Create a basic working implementation to validate the concept and ensure the core functionality works.

### 1.1 Core AI Integration
- [X] **Update AI Configuration**
  - [X] Modify `ai.ts` to accept `webSearchEnabled` parameter
  - [X] Implement mutual exclusion logic between web search and function tools
  - [X] Add Google Search tool configuration when enabled
  - [X] Test basic API integration with Gemini

- [X] **Basic Toggle Implementation**
  - [X] Add `webSearchEnabled` to `MyPluginSettings` interface in `main.tsx`
  - [X] Set default value to `false` in `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
  - [X] Add basic toggle state to `ChatPanel.tsx`
  - [X] Create simple toggle button component

- [X] **Basic Response Processing**
  - [X] Handle grounding metadata in AI responses
  - [X] Extract basic search results information
  - [X] Display simple search status in chat

## Phase 2: MVP (Minimum Viable Product)

### Goal
Enhance the POC with user experience improvements, better error handling, and production-ready features.

### 2.1 Enhanced User Interface

- [ ] **Visual Feedback Enhancements**
  - [X] Add search status indicator with spinner (simplified to spinner around search button)
  - [ ] Implement loading states during web search
  - [ ] Add search results display component
  - [ ] Style search results with proper formatting

### 2.2 Enhanced Response Processing
- [ ] **Advanced Grounding Metadata**
  - [ ] Parse and display search queries used
  - [ ] Show search result sources with links
  - [ ] Format search results in chat messages
  - [ ] Handle cases where no search was performed

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **API Changes**: Monitor Gemini API updates and maintain compatibility
- **Performance Issues**: Implement proper caching and optimization
- **Rate Limiting**: Add client-side rate limiting and graceful degradation

### User Experience Risks
- **Confusion about Limitations**: Clear communication about tool mutual exclusion
- **Performance Impact**: Optimize for minimal latency impact
- **Accessibility Issues**: Comprehensive accessibility testing and compliance

### Security Risks
- **API Key Exposure**: Implement secure key management
- **Data Privacy**: Follow privacy best practices and compliance
- **Abuse Prevention**: Implement proper rate limiting and monitoring

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- Gemini API availability and stability
- Google Search API access and quotas
- Obsidian plugin API compatibility

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing Tangent plugin architecture
- Current tool system implementation
- Settings and configuration system

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing
- [ ] Test toggle functionality
- [ ] Test API integration
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test state management

### Integration Testing
- [ ] Test with existing tools
- [ ] Test settings integration
- [ ] Test performance impact
- [ ] Test accessibility features

### User Acceptance Testing
- [ ] Test with real users
- [ ] Validate user experience
- [ ] Test edge cases
- [ ] Verify feature adoption

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a structured approach to adding Gemini's built-in grounding with Google Search to the Tangent plugin. The three-phase approach ensures:

1. **POC Phase**: Validates core functionality and technical feasibility
2. **MVP Phase**: Delivers a production-ready feature with good user experience
3. **Production Phase**: Adds advanced features, security, and monitoring

Each phase builds upon the previous one, allowing for iterative development and validation. The plan includes comprehensive testing, documentation, and risk mitigation strategies to ensure successful implementation and deployment.

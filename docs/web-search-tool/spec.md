# Product Requirements Document: Gemini Web Search Grounding

## Overview
Add Gemini's built-in grounding with Google Search capability to the Tangent plugin, allowing users to enable real-time web search for more accurate and up-to-date responses.

## Problem Statement
Currently, the Tangent plugin relies solely on the AI model's training data, which may be outdated or lack current information. Users need access to real-time web search to get the most current and accurate information for their queries.

## Solution
Integrate Gemini's built-in grounding feature with Google Search, providing users with a toggle to enable/disable web search functionality. When enabled, the AI will automatically search the web for relevant information to ground its responses.

## User Stories

### User Story 1: Enable Web Search

**I want to** toggle web search functionality on/off  
**So that** I can control when the AI should search the web for current information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A toggle button is visible in the chat input area
- [ ] Toggle state is clearly indicated (on/off)
- [ ] Toggle state persists across chat sessions
- [ ] Toggle is easily accessible and intuitive to use

### User Story 2: Web Search Integration
**As a** Tangent plugin user  
**I want to** have the AI automatically search the web when enabled  
**So that** I receive up-to-date and accurate information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] When web search is enabled, AI automatically searches for relevant information
- [ ] Web search results are seamlessly integrated into AI responses
- [ ] AI cites sources when using web search results
- [ ] Web search doesn't interfere with existing tool functionality

### User Story 3: Visual Feedback
**As a** Tangent plugin user  
**I want to** see when web search is being used  
**So that** I understand how the AI is gathering information

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Visual indicator shows when web search is active
- [ ] Search progress is communicated to the user
- [ ] Search results are clearly marked in responses
- [ ] Source attribution is visible and accessible

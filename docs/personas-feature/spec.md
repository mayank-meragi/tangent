# Personas Feature - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Overview
The Personas feature will allow users to select different AI personas at the beginning of a new chat, enabling the AI to behave according to specific roles like Product Manager, Prompt Enhancer, Technical Writer, etc. This system will be similar to the existing templates system but focused on AI behavior modification rather than conversation starters.

## Problem Statement
Currently, users need to manually instruct the AI about their desired role or behavior in each conversation. This is repetitive and inconsistent. Users want a way to quickly select predefined AI personas that will automatically configure the AI's behavior and communication style.

## Goals
- Provide users with predefined AI personas that modify the AI's behavior and communication style
- Allow users to create and manage custom personas
- Provide visual differentiation between different personas in the chat interface
- Integrate seamlessly with the existing template system architecture
- Maintain consistency with the current Tangent plugin design patterns

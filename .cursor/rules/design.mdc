- Whenever starting to work on a new feature, always follow the below mentioned steps.
- Step 1: Create a folder for the feature in the docs folder
- Step 2: Create a file for spec. 
  - Understand requirement from user and create a PRD
  - Add user stories and acceptance criteria for each feature
- Step 3: Create a file for design.
  - In this design doc, in detail mention how everything will be implemented
  - It should cover all the User Stories and Acceptance criteria mentioned in the spec file
  - Always use web search to help and facilitate your design decisions
- Step 4: Create a file for Tasks.
  - In the tasks file, create tasks for everything mentioned in the design doc.
  - Each task should be a `[ ]` checkbox.
  - It should have detailed sub tasks with its own checkbox, breaking down the main task.
  - Always create the tasks in 3 phases.
    - Phase 1: POC
      - This phase will have all the tasks that will allow the feature to quickly take rough shape that'll allow users to see if the feature is working correctly and their concept is correct.
    - Phase 2: MVP
      - This phase includes all the quality of life tasks that makes the feature easier and better to use
    - Phase 3: Production
      - This phase will have all the tasks that make the feature production level like security, efficiency, speed etc

General:
- Understand the complete code base before suggesting anything.
- Always ask user for follow up questions to help refine and understand the requirement
- IMPORTANT: Always wait for user to confirm before moving to the next step
  - after spec is created, ask user to read and confirm before moving on to the next step of creating design doc
  - after design doc is created, ask user to read and confirm before moving on to the next step of creating tasks doc

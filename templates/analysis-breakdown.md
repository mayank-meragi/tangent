# Analyze and Break Down

Please analyze {{topic}} and break it down into its key components. Help me understand the main elements, their relationships, and any underlying patterns or principles from a {{perspective}} perspective.

## Analysis Framework:
- **Core components and elements** - What are the fundamental parts?
- **Relationships and dependencies** - How do the parts connect and interact?
- **Patterns and principles** - What recurring themes or rules emerge?
- **Implications and applications** - What does this mean and how can it be used?
- **Strengths and weaknesses** - What are the advantages and limitations?
- **Context and background** - What historical or environmental factors matter?

## Please provide:
- Clear identification of key components
- Logical organization of information
- Practical insights and takeaways
- Visual or conceptual frameworks where helpful

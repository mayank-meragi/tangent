# Compare and Contrast

I need to compare {{item1}} and {{item2}} based on {{criteria}}. Please provide a comprehensive analysis that helps me understand the similarities, differences, and relative merits of each option.

## Comparison Framework:
- **Key characteristics** - What defines each option?
- **Similarities** - What do they have in common?
- **Differences** - What sets them apart?
- **Strengths and weaknesses** - What are the pros and cons of each?
- **Use cases** - When is each option most appropriate?
- **Trade-offs** - What are the key decisions to consider?

## Please provide:
- Side-by-side comparison where helpful
- Clear criteria-based evaluation
- Practical recommendations
- Context for when each option makes sense
- Potential hybrid approaches if applicable

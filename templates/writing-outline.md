# Create Writing Outline

I need help creating a comprehensive outline for writing about {{topic}}. The target audience is {{audience}} and the format is {{format}}.

## Please help me structure this with:
- Clear main sections and subsections
- Logical flow and progression
- Key points to cover in each section
- Supporting evidence or examples needed
- Transitions between sections
- Conclusion that ties everything together

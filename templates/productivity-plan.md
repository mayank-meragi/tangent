# Create Action Plan

I need to {{goal}} within a {{timeline}} timeframe. Can you help me create a structured action plan with clear steps, priorities, and timelines? Consider {{constraints}}.

## Plan Structure:
- **Clear objectives and milestones** - What are the key targets?
- **Prioritized action steps** - What needs to be done first?
- **Timeline and deadlines** - When should each step be completed?
- **Resource requirements** - What do I need to succeed?
- **Risk mitigation strategies** - What could go wrong and how to prevent it?
- **Success metrics** - How will I know I'm making progress?
- **Contingency plans** - What if things don't go as planned?

## Please provide:
- Specific, actionable steps
- Realistic timelines and priorities
- Resource and skill requirements
- Progress tracking methods
- Motivation and accountability strategies

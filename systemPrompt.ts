# Obsidian: How It Works

Obsidian is a powerful markdown-based note-taking app built around the idea 
of a **second brain** using **linked thinking**. It stores your notes 
locally in .md files and allows rich interlinking, tagging, and backlinking for knowledge management.

---

## 1. Notes and Markdown Basics

* Each note is a plain text file with .md extension.
* Use standard Markdown syntax for formatting.

**Example:**

markdown
# Heading 1
## Heading 2
- Bullet list
**Bold** and *Italic*


---

## 2. Internal Links ([[Link]])

* Use double brackets to link to another note: [[Note Name]].
* If the note doesn‚Äôt exist yet, Obsidian creates it when you click the link.
* Links can also point to headers or blocks:

  * [[Note Name#Heading]]
  * [[Note Name^block-id]]

**Example:**

markdown
See more in [[Project Overview]].


---

## 3. Backlinks

* Backlinks are notes that link **to** the current note.
* Found in the **Backlinks** panel in the right sidebar.
* Useful to see how a concept is referenced elsewhere.

**How to use:**

* Obsidian automatically tracks backlinks.
* No extra syntax needed.

---

## 4. Tags (#tag)

* Use #tags to categorize notes.
* Tags are global across the vault.
* Tags can have hierarchy: #project/website.
* View all tags in the **Tags** pane.

**Example:**

markdown
This note is part of #project/website.


---

## 5. Graph View

* Visual representation of how notes are linked.
* Shows local and global connections.
* Filter by tags, folders, or link depth.

---

## 6. Vaults

* A Vault is a folder containing all your notes.
* You can have multiple Vaults, but they don‚Äôt share links/tags.

---

## 7. Embedding Notes and Media

* Embed other notes: ![[Note Name]]
* Embed images or PDFs with the same syntax.

---

## 10. File Organization

* Use folders to organize notes.
* Folder structure is purely optional‚Äîlinks matter more.
* Use aliases and frontmatter for better linking and metadata.

**Frontmatter Example:**

yaml
---
aliases: ["Other Name"]
tags: [project, reference]
---


---

## Summary

* Link everything. Think in terms of connections.
* Tags for classification, links for structure.
* Use backlinks to surface hidden relationships.
* Do not use level 1 headings in your notes, ie, # Heading, # Another Heading, etc.

Obsidian works best when you focus on connection over hierarchy.


You have access to a persistent memory system that allows you to store and retrieve information across 
conversations. 

MEMORY SYSTEM:
- You can use the writeToMemory tool to append important information to your memory
- You can use the readMemory tool to retrieve previously stored information
- Memory content is automatically included as context in your conversations
- Use memory to remember user preferences, important facts, or context from previous conversations
- Memory entries are timestamped and organized chronologically

When appropriate, use the memory system to:
- Remember user preferences and settings
- Store important information shared by the user
- Keep track of ongoing projects or tasks
- Maintain context across multiple conversations
- Remember user's writing style, interests, or specific requirements
- If User mentions anything that you think will be useful for future reference, store it in memory.

TASK MANAGEMENT:
- You can use the queryDataviewTasks tool to search and retrieve tasks from the user's Obsidian vault
- You can use the writeDataviewTasks tool to create, update, and manage tasks in Obsidian files
- These tools integrate with the Dataview plugin for powerful task querying and management
- Tasks can include metadata like due dates, priorities, projects, and tags
- Support for emoji shorthands (üóìÔ∏è for due dates, ‚úÖ for completion, etc.)
- **Automatic integration with Obsidian Tasks plugin**: The queryDataviewTasks tool automatically applies the global filter from the Obsidian Tasks plugin (if installed and configured) to ensure consistency with the user's task filtering preferences

When working with tasks:
- Use queryDataviewTasks to find existing tasks, check completion status, or get task reports
- Use writeDataviewTasks to create new tasks, update existing ones, or manage task lists
- Consider using memory to store task patterns and user preferences
- Help organize tasks by projects, priorities, or timeframes
- The system automatically respects the user's global task filter settings from the Obsidian Tasks plugin

Tools:
- You have access to multiple tools to help you answer the user's questions.
- Always analyse the user's question and determine if any tool in your toolset is relevant to the question.
- If you need current date and time, check if relevant tools are available and use them.

Guidelines:
- Always try to interact with the user first before using any tools
- Unless the user explicitly asks you to use a tool, in that case, respond to the 
user with a message that you are using a tool to answer the question.
